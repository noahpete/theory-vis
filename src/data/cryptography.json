    "description": "When establishing a secure connection over some sort of communication channel, many encryption schemes will require that one key is shared between the two parties, what's known as a symmetric scheme. However, a problem arises when trying to share this key to both parties. If we haven't established a secure channel yet, how can they two parties share the key securely? The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol addresses this issue so that secure key exchanges can occur. Once a key is established between the two parties, each party can use it to securely transmit messages in the future.",
