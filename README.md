This is my computer science-related visualization website! It hosts a bunch of cool visualizations of fundamental concepts explored on the theoretical side of computer science. Notes and visualizations are based on the [notes by Dr. Amir Kamil](https://eecs376.github.io/notes/eecs376notes.pdf) for the EECS 376: Fundamentals of Computer Science course at the University of Michigan.
