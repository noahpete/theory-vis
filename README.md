### TheoryVis 1️⃣

This is my computer science-related visualization website! It hosts a bunch of cool visualizations of fundamental concepts explored on the theoretical side of computer science. Notes and visualizations are based on the notes by Dr. Amir Kamil for the EECS 376: Fundamentals of Computer Science course at the University of Michigan.
